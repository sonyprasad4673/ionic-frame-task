      <h3>1. Eat slowly</h3>
      <p> Did you know that eating too quickly can cause weight gain?</p>
      <p>According to research, faster eaters are more likely to be overweight, as compared to people who eat more
        slowly. In one study, it was also suggested that this is 115% more likely to happen in middle-aged women.</p>
      <p>As you eat, your body releases ‘fullness hormones’ that tell your brain you’ve eaten and should stop. However,
        as this process takes about 20 minutes, speedy eaters may consume too much food and only receive this signal
        later – which explains the ‘post-buffet bloat’ you may feel after a satisfying meal.</p>

      <h3>2. Drink more water</h3>
      <p>You may have heard of the saying to “drink 8 glasses of water a day”, yet not many may actually follow this,
        often
        choosing to count their total liquid intake instead – which usually includes sodas, coffee, and other beverages.
      </p>
      <p>Your body isn’t made up of soft drinks and beers, however. Depending on age, about 60% of the human body is
        made up of water. There are numerous benefits of drinking more water – it helps us to control our calorie
        intake, energises our muscles, keeps our kidneys healthy, and hydrates the skin.</p>
      <p>As you stay hydrated with water, you’ll also find yourself having fewer cravings for sugary or less healthy
        beverages.</p>

      <h3>3. Read nutrition labels</h3>

      </div>
      <p>If weight loss is one of your health goals, make it a habit to read the nutritional labels on your foods during
        your grocery shopping.</p>
      <p>Look out for the total amount of calories a product contains, and not just for 1 serving (which is typically
        what’s stated on the label).</p>
      <p>Reading nutrition labels will also help you to avoid only reading marketing labels like “high in fibre”, “low
        fat” or “zero sugar”, as these labels may be misleading. While a product is “high in calcium”, it could also be
        high in sugar – a detail you may have missed if you hadn’t read the nutrition label.</p>

      <h3>4.Eat more fruits and vegetables</h3>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <img src="/assets/vegetables.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A health survey of more than 65,000 participants found that people who ate the most portions of fruits or
          vegetables (7 or more) each day had a 42% reduced risk of dying (from any cause), compared to individuals who
          ate less than one portion a day.</p>
        <p>However, you may want to choose more fresh produce, as it was found that frozen and canned fruit can also
          increase the risk of dying by 17%.</p>
        <p>Need a tip on how you can add more fruits and vegetables into your diet? Buy some cut fruit after lunch and
          bring it to your workplace. The next time you’re hungry, that fruit will be the closest and most convenient
          snack you’ll reach for.</p>

      <h3>5. Work out (at least) 3 times a week</h3>
      <p>According to Active Health (an initiative by the Singapore Sports Council), adults should engage in at least
        150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week. The reality though, is that only 26% of
        Singaporeans do so.</p>
      <p>
        Hitting this goal doesn’t have to be difficult. You can try:

        <li>Do more of an activity you’re already doing</li>
        <li>Picking an activity you think you’ll enjoy doing, and start doing it</li>
      </p>
      <p>These can be small changes. For example, instead of walking with your dog, put on your running shoes and jog
        with your dog. And if you’re already running twice a week, add a third day to explore different routes at a
        relaxing, enjoyable pace.</p>

      <h3>6. Quit smoking</h3>
      <p>While legislation has placed disease-riddled images on cigarette boxes and eliminated tobacco advertising for
        decades, smoking is still a fairly common habit in Singapore. According to HealthHub, 6 Singaporeans die
        prematurely from smoking-related diseases every day.</p>
      <p>Quitting smoking can be challenging, but also one of the most life-changing decisions you make. Some strategies
        to overcome the addiction include exercise, support groups, relaxation techniques like breathing, or even
        nicotine replacement therapy.</p>
